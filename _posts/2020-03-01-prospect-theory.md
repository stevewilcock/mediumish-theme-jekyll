<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Shiller">Robert J. Shiller</a> (a nobel prize winner in economics), explains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory">Prospect theory</a>, devised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Kahneman</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky">Tversky</a> which is an absolutely critical behavioural economics concept for managers to grasp.

It provides managers with an incredibly powerful insight into human psychology, and how people are prone to perceive potential gains or losses differently. It is very useful concept to hold front of mind when making organisational changes, when people are prone to risk aversion, and reluctance to change and overreaction.

It explains so many irrational human behaviours. It helps you emphasise with colleagues when they react, for example, much more negatively to losses, or loss of perks that they do positively to gains. It also explains things like why people are hard-wired by their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system">limbic brain</a> to overreact to losses and hence do things like chase losses when gambling.
