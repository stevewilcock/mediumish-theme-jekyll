Steve Jobs once said you must "start with the customer experience and work backwards". However, most software, particularly enterprise software, is still built from the database design forwards, with a user interface slapped on top. You end up with an "implementation centric" design that expects the user to already know the underlying model in order to interact with the software. If the user's understanding falls short, they get a derrogatory and often unhelpful error. 

Terrible design in software is the norm, often because the software organisation fails to appreciate the need to put design at the heart of what they do. Programmers (the inmates) are designing software that people cannot use and driving everyone nuts. Alan Cooper gives a great overview of the effect this has on users and the cost it has on business - and makes the case for interaction design. 

This is a great book, and required reading for anyone from a technical background working on software.
